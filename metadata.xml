    <description>[h1]Welcome![/h1]
Repentance+ is a mod that adds (for now):
[list]
    [*] 23 new items;
    [*] 13 new trinkets;
    [*] 22 new cards;
    [*] 2 new pills;
    [*] 1 new chest
[/list] 
into the game!

This mod was designed to provide a more thorough Repentance experience, because it does what devs didn't want to do: brings [b]all remaining unlocks[/b], thematically fitting for tainted characters, into the game (awarding players new content for beating Greed mode, Boss Rush, Satan, Isaac and Blue Baby)!
[i]Please note[/i] that all new content is currently available from the get-go and isn't locked behind any achievements; making an achievement system will be our last step, we want to implement the items first.
[b]This mod doesn't unlock any vanilla achievement, and it won't even when the unlock system is introduced! [/b]

[h2]Our little team[/h2]
[list]
    [*] Mr. SeemsGood - lead programmer
    [*] erawalks - sprite artist and the man behind this whole idea for the mod (this mod exists only thanks to[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/ommys1/had_the_idea_for_the_mod_but_then_i_realized_that/] this[/url] reddit post of his)
    [*] Kartoschka - programmer
    [*] people from our Discord server - small help with the code and organizing our work
[/list] 

[h2]Wanna help or contribute?[/h2]
If you want to join our team, no problem! We are desperately looking for great coders to help us along the way, because the amount of work put into this mod is already huge, and we feel kind of exhausted, but we want to continue developing this mod regardless and [b]nearly double[/b] the amount of content it currently provides!
If you have no experience in making mods, but you have ideas to make the mod better, write them in discussions.

[h2]Special thanks[/h2]
[list]
    [*] to Agent Cucco for her Red Map trinket mod, from where I learned some useful stuff for the Red Map item
    [*] to Woufsauge for providing a guide on how to apply persistent player costumes and Isaac Lua API docs
    [*] to KingBobson for his mod Run Continues Past Mother (the item we used this concept for was scrapped, so use his mod instead!)
    [*] to Onyx and his Achievement System mod for helping us understand how to implement the unlocks system!
    [*] to everyone from #modding-dev channel on Isaac Discord who helped create this mod by answering my questions!

[/list] with ideas for all unlocks (we used these great ideas for couple of items, namely Temper Tantrum, Cherry Friends and Enraged Soul)

[h2]I found a bug![/h2]
Please refer to Bug Report discussion section and submit the bug here. This mod is currently in beta-state, and in parallel to making new content, we will try to polish the existing pieces of the mod!

[h2]And don't forget to use EID, yo![/h2]
